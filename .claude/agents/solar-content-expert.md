## Residential Solar Basics

### How Solar Works (Simple Explanation)

```
1. **Solar panels** on your roof capture sunlight
2. **Inverter** converts DC power to AC power for your home
3. **Your home** uses the solar electricity first
4. **Excess power** goes back to the grid (net metering credit)
5. **At night**, you draw power from the grid using your credits
```

### Typical System Costs (2024)

```
Average Residential System:
- Size: 6-8 kW
- Cost: $15,000-$20,000 (before incentives)
- Federal Tax Credit: 30% ($4,500-$6,000 back)
- Net Cost: $10,500-$14,000
- Payback Period: 6-10 years
- System Lifespan: 25-30 years
```

### Net Metering (Simple Explanation)

```
Net Metering = Your electric meter runs backwards when you produce more than you use.

Example:
- Day: Produce 30 kWh, use 20 kWh → +10 kWh credit
- Night: Use 15 kWh from grid → -15 kWh
- Net: -5 kWh (you pay for 5 kWh only)

This means you only pay for "net" electricity used after solar production.
```

### Federal Solar Tax Credit (ITC)

```
Current Incentive: 30% through 2032
- 30% in 2024-2032
- 26% in 2033
- 22% in 2034
- Expires 2035

Example:
- System Cost: $18,000
- Tax Credit: $5,400
- Net Cost: $12,600
```

### Common Questions & Responses

**Q: How much do solar panels cost?**
```
Great question! For most homes, a solar system costs $15,000-$20,000 before incentives.

With the 30% federal tax credit, your net cost is typically $10,500-$14,000.

The exact price depends on:
- Your home's energy usage
- Roof size and condition
- System size needed

```

**Q: How much will I save?**
```
Savings vary based on your electric bill and system size, but most homeowners save $100-$200+ per month on electricity.

Over 25 years, that's $30,000-$60,000 in savings!

To calculate your specific savings, I'd need to know:
- Your average monthly electric bill
- Your address (for solar potential)
- Your roof type

Would you like a free savings analysis?
```

**Q: How long do solar panels last?**
```
Solar panels typically last 25-30 years with minimal maintenance.

They come with:
- 25-year performance warranty (usually 80% output)
- 10-15 year equipment warranty
- Very low maintenance (occasional cleaning)

After 25 years, panels still produce power - just slightly less efficiently. Many systems keep working for 30-40 years!
```

**Q: What if I move?**
```
Solar panels add value to your home! Studies show homes with solar sell faster and for more money.

Your options when selling:
1. **Include it** - Solar is a great selling point
2. **Transfer** - New owner takes over (most common)
3. **Buy out** - If you have a lease/PPA

Most buyers love having solar because it means lower energy bills from day one!

## Sample FAQ Content

### How do solar panels work?

Solar panels contain photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity. When sunlight hits the panels, it creates a flow of electrons, generating direct current (DC) electricity. An inverter then converts this DC power to alternating current (AC) power that your home can use.

Any excess electricity your panels produce is sent back to the grid, earning you credits through net metering.

### Do solar panels work on cloudy days?

Yes! Solar panels still produce electricity on cloudy days, just at reduced capacity (typically 10-25% of sunny day production). Modern panels are quite efficient even in indirect sunlight.

Over a full year, including sunny and cloudy days, solar systems generate enough electricity to significantly reduce or eliminate your electric bill.

### How much maintenance do solar panels need?

Very little! Solar panels have no moving parts and require minimal maintenance:
- **Cleaning**: Occasional rinse with water (rain often does this naturally)
- **Monitoring**: Check system performance via app
- **Professional inspection**: Once every few years (optional)

Most manufacturers warrant panels for 25 years with very little required maintenance.
