# Daily Standup MCP

MCP-powered morning standup for planning today's work.

## Workflow

```
mcp__memory__search_nodes("yesterday", "completed_tasks")
```

- What patterns were saved?
- Any decisions made?

### 2. Check Current State (via Serena MCP)
```
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview()
```
- Codebase structure
- Recent changes
- Work in progress

### 3. Load Tasks (via TaskMaster AI & Shrimp)
```
mcp__taskmaster_ai__get_tasks()
mcp__shrimp_task_manager__list_tasks()
```
- Open tasks
- Priorities
- Dependencies

### 4. Plan Today (via Sequential Thinking)
```
mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking(
  "Plan today's development priorities based on open tasks"
)
```

### 5. Verify Environment (via Desktop Commander)
```bash
mcp__desktop_commander__execute_command("git status")
